## StarWars Speeder Bike, by Idmenthal

The speeder bike's mesh and textures in `mod/assets` are made from
"StarWars Speeder Bike [free download]" by Idmenthal
(https://sketchfab.com/idmental.id), from
https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/starwars-speeder-bike-free-download-1d0ea6fe43c1405b8d4b17722e166f6e,
licensed under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0
(http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). Changes: scaled to 98%,
turned to the broom's axes, reduced to four levels of detail, and the
textures resized to 1024 and 512 pixels, the base colour's blacks lifted
and 40% of the ambient occlusion multiplied into it, the roughness raised,
the metal taken out, both packed into one map, and the normal map left
out. Star Wars and the speeder bike's design belong to
Lucasfilm; this is a fan work with no connection to them.

## The speeder bike's sound

`mod/assets/sound` holds three loops and five one-shots cut from "Speeder
Bike.wav", the Star Wars SFX Archive's collection of the speeder bike's
sound from Return of the Jedi (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQTdXS5bTpA). The sound is Ben
Burtt's work for Lucasfilm, used here in a free fan mod with no connection
to Lucasfilm.
