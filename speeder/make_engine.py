"""The speeder's engine sounds: three loops the plugin crossfades, three
one-shots it plays on changes of speed, and the start-up and shutdown it
plays as Kliff gets on and off.

    py -3 speeder/make_engine.py ["Speeder Bike.wav"]

Given the Star Wars SFX Archive's "Speeder Bike.wav" (48 kHz float, laid
out as its video's chapters, each take set apart by silence):

    engine_idle    one period of the idle bed from 1:44, which repeats
                   sample for sample every 478,879 samples
    engine_close   12 s of the close bed from 3:22
    engine_boost   12 s of the boost bed from 0:32, softened: above
                   WHINE_CUT it falls 12 dB an octave, and it sits at
                   WHINE_SHARE of the close bed's level, since the plugin
                   layers it over the close engine at full speed (Seth
                   chose this, take 6, over the full boost whine as the
                   full speed sound, 5 October)
    accelerate     the acceleration take, 0:58.5 to 1:03.5
    boost_start    the boost's start, 0:23.1 to 0:28.7, its loudest tenth
                   of a second START_UNDER dB under the close bed's, since
                   it plays over the engine (Seth: "fix the boost sound
                   too", 5 October; it was 2.8 dB over). Its tone is the
                   recording's: low-passed and 6 dB under, the engine
                   covered it, and Seth chose take 5 of
                   speeder/out/boost_options, the full tone 4 dB under.
    boost_stop     the boost's end, 0:54.3 to 0:57.3, softened
    startup        the start-up, 0:02.35 to 0:05.05, its pitch climbing
                   from about 360 Hz to 1,100 Hz (the take at 0:01 is a
                   short burst and is left out)
    shutdown       the shutdown, 0:07.15 to 0:08.5, its pitch falling

The close and boost beds do not repeat exactly, so each loop's last second
is crossfaded into its start. Without the WAV the three loops are a
synthesised hum and the one-shots are silent.

Writes mod/assets/sound/<name>.raw, mono 16-bit PCM at 24 kHz, which
src/speeder.rc carries as resources 301 to 308 in the order above, and WAV
copies in speeder/out for listening. Every sound shares one scale, so the
takes keep their loudness relative to each other.
