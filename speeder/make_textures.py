"""The speeder's three textures, as the game's material wants them.

    py -3 speeder/make_textures.py <broom texture folder>

The folder holds the broom's cd_t0000_broom_0001.dds and _n.dds unpacked,
whose headers are the templates. Writes into speeder/out/files under the
game paths the plugin serves:

    _0001.dds     base colour, the model's own with a share of its ambient
                  occlusion multiplied in and its blacks lifted, 1024 px DXT1
    _0001_sp.dds  material map: R specular level, G roughness, B metal,
                  512 px DXT1 (CD Animator's NOTES.md has the channels)

The game's own hard surfaces are rough and not metallic (5 October: the
wagon's and the machine tank's _sp have R 255, G 231 and 247, B 0 at the
median; the broom's G 243), and their base colours sit at 56 to 67 sRGB
at the 10th percentile. The model's are glossy metal (G 88, B 37) over a
base that is near black (9), which the game drew very dark with odd
highlights (Seth: "the model is very dark and has weird shadows"). So the
speeder's metal goes to 0, its roughness into the game's range, its blacks
up to FLOOR, and only AO_SHARE of its baked occlusion stays.
    _0001_n.dds   a flat normal map, 64 px BC5. The model's normal map needs
                  tangents, and the vertex record's tangent bytes are not
                  decoded, so the speeder goes without.

Mips go down to 4 px. Every reserved word stays 0, which the game reads as
plain levels.
