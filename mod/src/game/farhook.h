// within 1 GB of the target and the game's image is surrounded by its own
// DLLs with nothing free nearby, so MH_CreateHook fails there with
// MH_ERROR_MEMORY_ALLOC. These hooks steal the first instructions (measured
// with MinHook's HDE decoder, rejected if any is rip-relative), put them in a
// trampoline anywhere in memory, and patch `mov rax, detour; jmp rax` over the
// entry. Other threads are suspended around the write.
