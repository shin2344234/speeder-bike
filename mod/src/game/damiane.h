// A copy of Broomy 1.0.3's damiane.h and damianepatches.h. The speeder only
// needs Moved: with Broomy installed, Kliff's lower chart is the one Broomy
// serves with these splices, and riderfix finds its words there.
//
// Damiane on Broomy. Kliff, Damiane and Oongka ride with Kliff's two riding
// charts, and each broom action in them has only his node, so Damiane played
// his clips with her hands open beside the handle (Oongka's fit). The game
// plays the node whose group hash is the rider's, so damianepatches.h gives
// every broom action a node of hers, naming her own clips and lean blend
// (damianeclips.h, mod.cpp). broomy.cpp serves the charts built here,
// riderfix finds its words in the lower one through Moved, and
// tests/chartcheck.cpp checks both against the shipped files.
