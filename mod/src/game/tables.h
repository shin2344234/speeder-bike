// The game's static info tables. Two ways in, because one is not enough.
//
// Resolve() is Flight Freedom's route: find the resolver clone that names the
// table, read the global it loads, walk the def array. It works for statusinfo
// and every other table the exe reaches through a `lea r8,[rip+"<name>"]`.
//
// ResolveByManager() is for the rest. skill has no resolver clone: its name
// lives behind an accessor stub, so nothing in the image passes "skill" to the
// template and Resolve will never find it. Every table does have a manager
// class with RTTI, and mem's vtable walk finds the global holding it.
