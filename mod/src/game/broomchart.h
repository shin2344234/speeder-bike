// Broomy's own action charts, made from the Wyvern's each time the game
// reads them. Pure functions, like broomrows: the offline check
// (tests/chartcheck.cpp) runs them against the shipped files.
//
// Under the Wyvern's own charts the broom played the Wyvern's animations on
// its skeleton, which drew it under the ground, and the Wyvern's sounds.
// Broomy's row names the charts of GoldStar, a cut dragon no character uses,
// and the plugin serves those files as the Wyvern's charts with every
// animation and blend they name pointed at the broom's.
//
// A chart names each animation and blend by path: a length byte counting
// the terminating zero, the text, then the zero. The file holds absolute
// offsets, so a path can change only for another of the same length. Each
// animation path becomes an alias of the same length in the same folder, a
// name no pack holds, and Redirect sends the game's loads of that alias (the
// animation, its LOD copy and its metadata) to broom files. Each blend
// becomes an alias that loads the broom's own blend, broom_riding_move.
